# Getting Started with Webpack Starter Kit

> Typescript is supported! \
> Server Side Render is supported!

## Features

- Webpack@5
- React@17
- Typescript
- SSR

## Motivation

As a fresh man in front-end field, lots of technology run into my eyes, such as [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js). Even though they are powerful and convenient enough for normal development, it isn't benefit to a programmer's growth in the long run.\
For easier react development experience, I create these templates from scratch, with the latest tool chains from dev to build to production.

## Available Template

- [react-typescript-template](./packages/react-typescript-template/)
- [react-ssr-typescript-template](./packages/react-ssr-typescript-template/)
